WP Lynx allows you to mimic Facebook's wall links in your WordPress posts.

== Description ==

WP Lynx allows you to create stylized links akin to those in Facebook. These stylized links, known as lynx prints, can contain a thumbnail image of any of the images on the linked page, plus a short excerpt from the page. The images are automatically cached on your server (no hot-linking), and the content is intelligently scraped.
